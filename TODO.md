## Overall
### Kinda necessary
- ~Wifi scan list graphically with **LVGL**~
- ~Connect to wifi from scan list~
    - ~Touch keyboard with LVGL~
- ~Find a way to scan the network?~
    - ~Device list with ARP pings~
    - ~Top 1000 port scan with TCP~
- Record cool data in SD
    - Wifi Scan list (Maybe bluetooth too?)
    - In-network scan
- Fix pcb issues for large # of scans
- Improve ARP pings
- Improve TCP ping

### Less necessary but still should
- Access cool data by web interface (hosted on ESP)

### Maybe, maybe not
- Double buffering (if need 30+ fps or if display refreshing issues persist with LVGL)
